			<h1>Terms of Service </h1>
			These terms of service are a contract between you, the user, and Unheard.fm (the Site/the Platform). They describe the expected usage of the Site and associated services and content. By registering for the Site, you agree to follow these terms of service, as well as our privacy policy. The terms may change at any time, and all users will be notified ahead of time in case of any substantial change. We reserve the right to modify or remove access to the Site at any time based on these terms.

			<h2>Content rights</h2>
			Users retain the full rights to any original content they post to Unheard.

			By posting content to Unheard, you give us a nonexclusive license to publish it on the Site, including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing it). In consideration for Unheard granting you access to and use of the platform, you agree that Unheard may enable advertising on the services, including in connection with the display of your content or other information. We may also use your content to promote Unheard, including its products and content. We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission. We do not explicitly or implicitly endorse any of the content posted to the site. 

			You are responsible for the content you post. This means you assume all risks related to it, including someone else’s reliance on its accuracy, or claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights. 

			You are welcome to post content on the Site that you have published elsewhere, as long as you have the rights you need to do so. By posting content to Unheard, you represent that doing so doesn’t conflict with any other agreement you’ve made. 

			By posting content you didn’t create to Unheard, you are representing that you have the right to do so. For example, you are posting a work that’s in the public domain, used under license (including a free license, such as Creative Commons), or a fair use.

			We reserve the right to remove any posted content for any reason, including but notwithstanding violation of the terms outlined here. You also have the right to delete any of your own posted content at any time. 

			<h2>Posting guidelines</h2>
			While we welcome a diverse range of voices and perspectives on the platform, our first priority is creating a safe and respectful space for dialogue. The following guidelines are meant to form a standard of behavior for the Platform and clarify expectations for the types of behavior that will not be tolerated. 

			Any content (user posts, comments, biography text) that meets the following guidelines may be subject to written warning, limited feed prioritization, removal, or a user ban. 

			<h3>Hate speech</h3>
			Any content that espouses hatred against a person or peoples on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or age. This includes comments that exhibit or encourage discrimination against a person or peoples for the same criteria. 

			<h3>Incitement or threats of violence</h3>
			Any content that explicitly or implicitly encourages or calls for violence against an individual or group. 

			<h3>Violation of privacy</h3>
			Any content that reveals the private information (private email, phone number, physical address, or other non-publicly obtainable details) of other users or artists without their explicit consent.

			<h3>Artificial interactions</h3>
			Any content or site interaction (vote, comment, like/dislike) that is explicitly manipulated or manufactured through artificial means (bots, scripts), coercion, or incentive.
